## A - Risks

While not much was found, the interaction of YieldGenerator and AP are a very concerning area.

I specifically looked at decimals, donations and changes

I also found multiple hypothetical ways to DOS ETHOS, due to incorrect math from Compound

NOTE: That because you only have one depositor, and because of how reporting works with Ethos4626, that the DOS should not happen under most circumnstances
